# WK8-Weather-Dashboard-Challenge

## Description 

Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed

- When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity

- When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Approach

- I started by creating the necessary variables to retrieve the current weather 

- Next I retrived the forecast weather for the searched city

- I updated some of the CSS properties to style the dynamically created elements

- I then added functionality to dynamically generate buttons for each previous search city

- Added functionality for each button to retrieve the current and forecast weather for the city when the button is clicked
